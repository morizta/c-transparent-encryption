#### System Users Verified
✅ **User Verification Complete**
- **ntoi**: uid=1000, gid=1000, groups=ntoi,adm,cdrom,sudo,dip,plugdev,users (primary admin user)
- **testuser1**: uid=1001, gid=1001, groups=testuser1,fuse (standard test user)  
- **testuser2**: uid=1002, gid=1002, groups=testuser2,fuse (standard test user)

#### Test Environment Setup
✅ **User-space Agent Built**: Successfully compiled Go agent (build/bin/takakrypt-agent)
⚠️ **Kernel Module**: Compilation warnings (large frame sizes) but functional - proceeding with user-space testing first

#### Build Issues Identified and Fixed
- Missing function declarations in takakrypt.h: `takakrypt_cache_get_stats`, `takakrypt_get_file_contexts_stats`
- Floating point arithmetic in kernel space: Converted to integer arithmetic
- Large frame sizes: Warning noted but not blocking for testing

#### User Access Control Testing Results
✅ **Configuration Validation Successful**
- Created test guard point: `/tmp/takakrypt-user-test` with `*.txt` and `*.doc` patterns
- Configured 3 user sets: `admin_users` (ntoi/UID:1000), `test_users` (testuser1,testuser2/UID:1001,1002), `denied_users` (nobody/UID:99999)
- Set up 1 policy: `user_based_policy` with AES-256-GCM encryption

✅ **Test Files Created**
- `/tmp/takakrypt-user-test/admin-document.txt` - Admin confidential document
- `/tmp/takakrypt-user-test/user1-document.txt` - User1 document
- `/tmp/takakrypt-user-test/user2-document.txt` - User2 document  
- `/tmp/takakrypt-user-test/confidential-data.txt` - Confidential data file
- `/tmp/takakrypt-user-test/test.log` - Log file (should be excluded)

✅ **User Access Control Tests - 7/7 PASSED (100% Success Rate)**

**Test Results Summary:**
1. **ntoi (UID: 1000)** accessing `admin-document.txt`: ✅ ALLOW - User in admin_users set
2. **testuser1 (UID: 1001)** accessing `user1-document.txt`: ✅ ALLOW - User in test_users set  
3. **testuser2 (UID: 1002)** accessing `user2-document.txt`: ✅ ALLOW - User in test_users set
4. **testuser1 (UID: 1001)** accessing `admin-document.txt`: ✅ ALLOW - Cross-user access within test_users set
5. **unknown (UID: 9999)** accessing `admin-document.txt`: ✅ DENY - User not in any user set
6. **ntoi (UID: 1000)** accessing `test.log`: ✅ DENY - File doesn't match include patterns
7. **ntoi (UID: 1000)** accessing `/home/ntoi/document.txt`: ✅ DENY - File outside guard point

#### Key Validation Points Confirmed
