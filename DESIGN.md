# Transparent Encryption System Design

## Project Overview
Building a transparent encryption system similar to Thales CTE/LDT that provides seamless file-level encryption without application modification.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Encryption Agent** - Main service that handles encryption/decryption operations
2. **File System Interceptor** - Intercepts file I/O operations at kernel/system level
3. **Policy Engine** - Manages encryption policies and access controls
4. **KMS Integration** - Retrieves keys and policies from external KMS
5. **Configuration Manager** - Handles guard points and policy configuration

### Key Features

- **Transparent Operation**: Files encrypted/decrypted automatically without application changes
- **Policy-Based**: Flexible policies based on users, processes, resources
- **Guard Points**: Specific directories/files under encryption control
- **KMS Integration**: External key management system integration
- **Multi-Level Control**: User-set, process-set, and resource-set policies

## Technology Stack Considerations

### Language Options Analysis:

**C/C++**
- Pros: Direct kernel integration, high performance, system-level access
- Cons: Complex memory management, harder maintenance
- Best for: Kernel modules, file system drivers

**Go**
- Pros: Good performance, excellent concurrency, easy deployment
- Cons: Limited kernel-level access, requires system calls
- Best for: User-space agents, policy engines

**Rust**
- Pros: Memory safety, performance, growing kernel support
- Cons: Steeper learning curve, smaller ecosystem
- Best for: Safe system programming

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- **C**: Kernel module for file system interception
- **Go**: User-space agent for policy management, KMS integration
- **Configuration**: JSON/YAML for policies and guard points

## System Components Design

### 1. Guard Points
- Directory/file paths under encryption control
- Configurable inclusion/exclusion patterns
- Hierarchical policy inheritance

### 2. Policy Engine
```
Policy Types:
- User-based: Encrypt files for specific users
- Process-based: Encrypt files created by specific processes
- Resource-based: Encrypt specific file types/locations
- Time-based: Conditional encryption based on schedules
```

### 3. Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "guard_points": [
    {
      "path": "/secure/data",
      "policy": "high_security",
      "recursive": true
    }
  ],
  "policies": {
    "high_security": {
      "encryption_algorithm": "AES-256-GCM",
      "user_sets": ["admin", "security_team"],
      "process_sets": ["trusted_apps"],
      "resource_patterns": ["*.doc", "*.pdf"]
    }
  },
  "kms": {
    "endpoint": "https://kms.company.com",
    "auth_method": "certificate"
  }
}
```

### 4. KMS Integration
- Pull encryption keys from external KMS
- Retrieve policy updates
- Support multiple KMS providers
- Secure key caching with TTL

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Design & Planning
- [IN PROGRESS] System architecture design
- Technology stack selection
- Configuration format definition

### Phase 2: Foundation Components
- Basic encryption/decryption engine
- Configuration parser
- KMS client implementation

### Phase 3: File System Integration
- Kernel module for file interception
- User-space agent communication
- Basic transparent encryption

### Phase 4: Policy Engine
- User/process/resource set management
- Policy evaluation engine
- Dynamic policy updates

### Phase 5: Production Features
- Logging and monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- Comprehensive testing

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Security**: Secure key handling and memory protection
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Tamper-resistant policy engine
3. **Privilege Separation**: Minimal required permissions
4. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
5. **Fail-Safe**: Secure behavior on system failures

## Next Steps

1. Finalize technology stack selection
2. Create detailed component specifications
3. Define API contracts between components
4. Implement proof-of-concept prototype
